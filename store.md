### Important

This table will show orders placed in the [OpenIPC store](https://store.openipc.org) that have some problems.
If your order is not here, you can rest assured for now.
We take a very responsible approach to the delivery of all orders.
The result is always delivery to the customer or a refund to the customer's card.
However, there are intermediate situations, for example, when the goods are delayed at customs.
In this case, we are powerless for some time (sometimes it is significant) and call on everyone to remain calm and wait for the situation to be resolved. 
Thank you for your understanding.
