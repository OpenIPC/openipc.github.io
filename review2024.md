## A 2024 Year of Innovation

Welcome to a special edition highlighting the most impactful developments within the OpenIPC project over the past year.
The community's dedication has driven significant progress, and we're excited to share these achievements with you.

### Key Developments in FPV section

- AIO Devices Take Flight: OpenIPC led the charge in bringing All-In-One (AIO) devices to the forefront. Our team was the first to release AIO devices based on OpenIPC firmware, setting the trend for others.
- MSPOSD Enhanced with VTX Menu: The Mario unit's base firmware now supports the latest MSPOSD, complete with a VTX menu. Updates are ongoing, and the new vtxmenu.ini is already in the configurator.
- OpenIPC Ruby Emerges: A single developer's hard work brought OpenIPC Ruby to life.
- mavfwd Gets an Upgrade: The updated mavfwd improves performance, fixing 1080p 120fps on the IMX335. AIO firmware users should update, and experimenting with "-a 15" could reduce traffic further.
- Configurator Refined: A new "read camera settings" button simplifies setup. The configurator is a major reason 60% of users have switched to OpenIPC.
- Strategic Partnerships: OpenIPC is gaining recognition! RunCam, Emax, and BetaFPV are now collaborating with OpenIPC, with new product launches in the works.
- OpenHD Reconciliation: Prior misunderstandings with OpenHD have been resolved, paving the way for future collaboration.
- Telemetry Port Update: Default telemetry ports have changed: 14750 for Venc builds, 14550 for external use on NVR. Update older firmware accordingly.
- 40MHz Mode on the Horizon: The community is eager for PixelPilot to adopt 40MHz mode.
- High Frame Rate Achieved: Radxa Zero 3W can now display 120fps.
- Zoom Bash Script Integration: A zoom script with 30 levels and focus set to infinity is now part of the firmware.
