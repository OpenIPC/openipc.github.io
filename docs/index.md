## OpenIPC is an alternative open firmware for your IP camera.   [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)][gitter]   [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)][paypal]
_(based on Buildroot)_

OpenIPC is an open source operating system from the [open community](opencollective)
targeting for IP cameras with ARM and MIPS processors from several manufacturers in 
order to replace that closed, opaque, insecure, often abandoned and unsupported 
firmware pre-installed by a vendor.

OpenIPC [firmware][firmware] comes as binary pre-compiled files for easy 
installation by end-user. Also, we provide full access to the source files for 
further development and improvement by any capable programmer willing to 
contribute to the project. OpenIPC source code is released under one of the most 
simple open source license agreements, [MIT License][mit], giving users express 
permission to reuse code for any purpose, even as part of a proprietary software.
We only ask you politely to contribute your improvements back to us. We would 
be grateful for any feedback and suggestions.

Historically, OpenIPC [firmware][firmware] only supported SoC manufactured by 
HiSilicon, but as the development continues, the list of supported processors
expands. Today, it also includes chips from _Ambarella_, _Anyka_, _Fullhan_, _Goke_,
_GrainMedia_, _Ingenic_, _MStar_, _Novatek_, _SigmaStar_, _XiongMai_, and is 
expected to grow further.

More information about the [project][project] is available in our [website][website]
and on the [wiki][wiki].
