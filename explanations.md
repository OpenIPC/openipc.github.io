### OpenIPC Bureau

"OpenIPC Bureau" is a group of individuals (developers) and friendly teams under the umbrella of our community,
working on integrating firmware for devices from various manufacturers and providing basic consultations and training.  

This work isn't commercial, but to speed things up, encourage people, and boost enthusiasm, it can be supported 
through donations via the [OpenCollective][opencollective] platform.
