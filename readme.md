## Alternative open firmware for your IP camera
_(based on Buildroot)_

[![Telegram](https://openipc.org/images/telegram_button.svg)][telegram]

### Introduction

OpenIPC is an open source operating system from the [open community][opencollective]
targeting for IP cameras with ARM and MIPS processors from several manufacturers in
order to replace that closed, opaque, insecure, often abandoned and unsupported
firmware pre-installed by a vendor.

OpenIPC [firmware][firmware] comes as binary pre-compiled files for easy
installation by end-user. Also, we provide full access to the source files for
further development and improvement by any capable programmer willing to
contribute to the project. OpenIPC source code is released under one of the most
simple open source license agreements, [MIT License][mit], giving users express
permission to reuse code for any purpose, even as part of a proprietary software.
We only ask you politely to contribute your improvements back to us and also be 
sure to contact us if you use our project for [commercial purposes][price]. We would
be grateful for any feedback and suggestions. The use of the OpenIPC project and its 
components for military purposes is not permitted.

Historically, OpenIPC [firmware][firmware] only supported SoC manufactured by
HiSilicon, but as the development continues, the list of supported processors
expands. Today, it also includes chips from _Ambarella_, _Anyka_, _Fullhan_, _Goke_,
_GrainMedia_, _Ingenic_, _MStar_, _Novatek_, _SigmaStar_, _XiongMai_, and is
expected to grow further.

More information about the [project][project] is available in our [website][website]
and on the [wiki][wiki].
